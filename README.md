This repository contains my desktop applications created using the PyQt5 library.

## The Ruffier Test

This application will allow you to use the Rufier test to conduct a primary diagnosis of your health.
There are 2 variants of the application. 
The task 1 folder contains a simple version of the application. 
In this version, there are only 3 windows: The Greeting, the main part, and the result. 
Eventually, the user will receive the Rufier index, which will report the health status. 
In the second version of the application, each stage is shown in a separate window and a new timer is added that counts down the time of the stage. 
Compared to the first option, you can not skip any stage, as the buttons are locked until the timer ends.
